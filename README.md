# Project Data Base

In this project I will make the Data Base in the currently work

## First Step: Layout

With the Excel Spreadsheet in Excel, I thought about how to apply the Normal Forms of the Relational Data Base according with the 12 Rules of the Codd
So I drew the Entity Relation Diagram:

When implementing this idea in Excel tables I discovered that I could join 2 tables (rollstock and pouches) in a table called Materials, this way it was in PowerBI

## Second Step: Dashboard

After cleaning data the next step was to make the principal dashboard, for example this image show the change of trend in July and August:
